# quiz-app

This project showcases the use of various javascript methods and DOM selectors to dynamically render multiple choice questions in a quiz app. The score is calculated when user submits by cross checking stored selected answers array vs array of correct answers. 

To take the quiz yourself and see how it works, check it out in your VSC or open in codePen: https://codepen.io/danielcornejodev/pen/PoeNrXw
